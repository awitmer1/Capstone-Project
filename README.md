# devCodeCamp Capstone Project: Traveling with Fido

Traveling with Fido is a travel companion app for pet owners who are looking for pet-friendly accomodations in unfamiliar places. It was inspired by my own road trips with my dog and struggling to find places that were accessible to both of us.

Traveling with Fido is a full stack application built with React and Django, as well as JWT for authentication/authorization and a fully working register/login system on the React side. This project was built part-time over a five-week period and showcases the skills developed in my software development course at devCodeCamp.
